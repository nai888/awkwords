<h2 id="Using_Awkwords">Using Awkwords</h2>
<div id="introsec">
<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction: what Awkwords is</h3>
<p>Awkwords is a simple online application that randomly generates words based on a given pattern. 
You can use it to make words for a constructed language, to get an original nickname, just for fun or whatever.</p>
<p class="note">note: Awkwords the word generator has nothing to do with <a href="http://awk.info/?doc/tools/awkwords.html">Awkwords the documentation markup language</a> nor with the awk text processing language as such. 
The matching names are purely coincidental.</p>
<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<h3 id="Concept">Concept</h3>
<p>The most notable parts of the generator's interface are the parts labeled <i>shortcuts</i> and <i>pattern</i>.
Shortcuts allow you to assign each capital letter something to generate. Everywhere you use 
one of them in the word pattern the content assigned to it will be used in that place. 
It's useful to put the language's sounds here.</p>
<p>There are several predefined groups of sounds - V for <u>v</u>owels, C for <u>c</u>onsonants, T for s<u>t</u>ops, 
F for <u>f</u>ricatives, and N for <u>n</u>asals - with a few very common sounds filled in, 
but you can change these assignments to whatever you desire.</p>
<p>A shortcut can be used also to represent syllable onset, 
coda and other clusters, or whatever. Simply make shortcuts you find useful when making the pattern. 
A shortcut can be thought of as a pattern that can be inserted into another patterns - that's right how it works.
A shortcut can be used in other shortcuts as well.
You can use everything the same way in the shortcuts as in the main word pattern - slashes, brackets, 
weighting, escaping. These will be discussed next.</p>
<h3 id="Basic_syntax">Basic syntax</h3>
<p>The content of the field named <i>pattern</i> defines how the word will be formed. Lower case (small) letters 
represents these letters in the word, while capital letters are used as shortcuts 
(what each of them stand for is defined in the rows above). To write the structure, there are these characters: </p>

<ul class="blocks">
<li>
<p><b>/</b> &nbsp; Slashes divide the text into options, from which one is randomly chosen. </p>
<p><i>example: &nbsp;</i> <code>tu/top/kan</code> generates either <i>tu</i>, <i>top</i>, or <i>kan</i></p> 
<p>By default, all of them have the same chance of being chosen. This can be changed by giving 
each option a <a href="#Assigning_weights">weight</a>. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>[ ]</b> &nbsp; What's inside square brackets is treated as a single unit. </p>
<p><i>example: &nbsp;</i> <code>s[tu/top/kan]</code> generates either <i>stu</i>, <i>stop</i> or <i>skan</i></p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>( )</b> &nbsp; Round brackets work the same way as square brackets, the only difference is that 
what's inside them can either appear in the word or not. Both variants are equally probable. </p>
<p><i>example: &nbsp;</i> <code>s(tu/top/kan)</code> renders a word that always begins with <i>s</i> and in half of
the cases continues with either of <i>tu</i>, <i>top</i>, or <i>kan</i> - so the possible results are: 
<i>s, stu, stop, skan</i></p>
</li> 
</ul>

<p>Brackets can be unlimitedly nested one into another.</p> 
<p><i>example: &nbsp;</i> <code>at(a(z))</code> in half of the cases renders only <i>at</i>. 
In the other half, the result can be equally probably <i>ata</i> or <i>ataz</i>. <i>atz</i> is impossible 
because the block <code>(z)</code> is inside requires <code>a</code> to be rendered.</p>

<h3 id="Assigning_weights">Assigning weights</h3>
<p>Weight is a number that multiplies the chance of being chosen of the option it applies to. 
Weight is written after an asterisk in the option it applies to.</p> 
<p><i>example: &nbsp;</i> <code>a/b*3/c/d/kek*6</code> </p>
<p>This generates <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, or <i>d</i> each with the same probability. Compared to each of these, 
the probability of generating <i>b</i> is three times higher and for <i>kek</i> six times higher 
(that means, <i>kek</i> is twice as probable as <i>b</i>). 
That's because <i>b</i> has weight 3 and <i>kek</i> has weight 6. Options without specified 
weight have weight 1. The number used as weight must be an integer between 1 and 128.</p>

<h3 id="Escaping_characters">Escaping characters</h3>
<p>Double quotes (<i>"these"</i>) have a special function: characters enclosed by them are simply put into the word, 
ignoring the meaning they would otherwise have for the generator. This way anything including capital letters, 
slashes, brackets, etc. can be generated.</p>
<p><i>example: &nbsp;</i> <code>heh"[mY/worD)]"</code> generates literally <i>heh[mY/worD)]</i>

<h3 id="Pattern_filtering">Pattern filtering</h3>
<p>When using a pattern to generate words, you may want to somehow restrict it so that some combinations 
in certain places are forbidden. This is what filters can do. If a filter is set for some part of the pattern
it is always checked whether what generated by that part of the pattern matches the filter. If it does 
the word is filtered out - it will not appear in the output.
</p>
<p>Filters are defined by writing the <code>^</code> character right after the fragment of the pattern to be filtered
followed by the content to filter out: <i>[pattern&nbsp;fragment]^filter</i> . 
Multiple filters can be set for the same fragment: <i>[pattern&nbsp;fragment]^filter2^filter2^filter3</i> .
<p><i>example: &nbsp;</i> <code>[VV]t[VV]^aa^ii^uu</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let V be a shortcut for [a/i/u])</p>
<p> In this example, the first <code>[VV]</code> yield any of all the nine combinations - for any of the three letters
for the first V there may appear any of them for the second V. Thus the possibilities are: 
<i>aa, ai, au, ia, ii, iu, ua, ui, uu</i> . <br>
For the second <i>[VV]</i>, there are three filters applied: these exclude cases when the <i>[VV]</i> yields 
<i>aa, ii, </i>or<i>uu</i>, i.e. when the letters happen to be the same. Thus, just 
<i>ai, au, ia, iu, ua, ui</i> are accepted results.</p>

<h3 id="Generating_words">Generating words</h3>
<p>When everything is set up, click the <i>Generate</i> button to generate the words. There are several adjustments: </p>
<ul>
<li>the number of words to be generated</li>
<li>new line each - write each word on a separate line</li>
<li>filter duplicates - let each word occur at most once in the output</li>
</ul>
<p>After the words are generated, some statistics are shown below them. These tell how many words were printed
to the output, how many words were filtered out, how much time it took, and how many possible ways the pattern
can render. Note that the number of actually different words possible to get with the pattern may be actually
lower because of there being more ways to get the same word.</p>

<h3 id="Saving_and_loading_settings">Saving and loading settings</h3>
<p>By clicking the <i>Save...</i> button you get a file with the current settings of Awkwords. Save this file 
to your disk. Next time when you need these settings again, click on <i>Load > </i>, select the file you want to load 
and click <i>Load settings</i>.</p>
